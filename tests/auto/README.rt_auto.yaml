# This README describes the format of rt_auto.yaml, which is read by rt_auto.py in order to get git- and GitHub-related settings, and optionally to provide arguments (to avoid having to type long command-line arguments).
# The required section is named 'git', and has two sub-sections, one required, and one optional:
# config (required): Specifies user.email and user.name settings tied to the user's GitHub account
# github (optional): Specifies the repository and base branch (i.e. the destination of the PR) to check
# An example configuration can be found below:
args:
  machine: cheyenne
  account: P48503002
  workdir: /glade/p/ral/jntp/CCPP_regression_testing/NCAR_ufs-weather-model/run/
  envfile: machine/cheyenne.ncar # The default machine file is machine/{machine_name}, but you can specify your own
  additional_args: -n control_p8 intel # Specify any additional options you'd like to pass to rt.sh; here we specify to only run the "control_p8" test for intel compilers
git:
  config:
    user.email: user@test.edu
    user.name: test_user
  github:
    org: NCAR
    repo: ufs-weather-model
    base: main
